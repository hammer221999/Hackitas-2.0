# Code of Conduct
Hackitas stands for making the world a better place, through hacking of course! And this includes goodwill toward your peers. Hackitas does not tolerate any kind of harassment, violence or any form of unethical activity.

## Harassment
Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal or written comments related to gender, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. If what you're doing is making someone feel uncomfortable, that counts as harassment and is enough reason to stop doing it. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors, judges, mentors, volunteers, organizers, Hackitas staff and anyone else at the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. Participants should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material both in their hacks and during the event. Both staff and volunteers should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.

## Photography
Photography is encouraged, but other participants must be given a reasonable chance to opt out from being photographed. If they object to the taking of their photograph, comply with their request. It is inappropriate to take photographs in contexts where people have a reasonable expectation of privacy (in bathrooms or where participants are sleeping).

## Action & Reporting
If a participant engages in any of the aforementioned activities, Hackitas may take any action that they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event. HackBMU representatives will be happy to help participants contact campus security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance. We expect participants to follow these rules at all hackathon venues, online interactions in relation to the event, hackathon-related social events, and on hackathon supplied transportation.

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please [report it immediately](Contact.md "Contact") to one of the organizers. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.
